MaskImageProject
================

UIImage&UIImageView's categories.

##What's This?
Add a property in UIImageView's category named 'cornerRadius' instead for CALayer's cornerRadius and MaskToBounds at same time.

##What's the difference between UIImageView's cornerRadius and CALayer's?
Better performance in FPS.
